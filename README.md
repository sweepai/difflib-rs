# difflib-rs

A high-performance Rust implementation of Python's `difflib.unified_diff` function with PyO3 bindings.

## Overview

This package provides a Rust-based implementation of the unified diff algorithm, offering significant performance improvements over Python's built-in `difflib` module while maintaining API compatibility.

## Features

- **ðŸš€ 3-5x Faster**: Consistently outperforms Python's difflib across all file sizes and change patterns
- **100% Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for `difflib.unified_diff` with identical output
- **Thoroughly Tested**: Comprehensive test suite ensuring byte-for-byte compatibility with Python's implementation
- **Easy to use**: Simple Python API with PyO3 bindings

## Performance

The Rust implementation consistently outperforms Python's built-in `difflib` module while producing identical output:

### Key Optimizations

The performance improvements come from:
- **FxHashMap (Firefox's fast hash)** instead of Python's dict for sparse representation
- **Efficient HashMap swapping** to avoid allocations (using `std::mem::swap`)
- **Queue-based matching algorithm** for better cache locality
- **Optimized string operations** leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions
- **Popularity heuristic** to skip overly common elements (matches Python's algorithm)

## Installation

### From pip
```bash
pip install difflib-rs
```

### Build from source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sweepai/difflib-rs.git
cd difflib-rs

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install build dependencies
pip install maturin pytest

# Build and install
maturin develop --release
```

## Usage

This is a **drop-in replacement** for Python's `difflib.unified_diff`. Simply replace your import:

```diff
- from difflib import unified_diff
+ from difflib_rs import unified_diff

# Compare two sequences of lines
a = ['line1', 'line2', 'line3']
b = ['line1', 'modified', 'line3']

diff = unified_diff(
    a, b,
    fromfile='original.txt',
    tofile='modified.txt',
    fromfiledate='2023-01-01',
    tofiledate='2023-01-02'
)

for line in diff:
    print(line, end='')
```

**Note**: Currently only `unified_diff` is supported. Other `difflib` functions are not implemented.

### Extra: String-based API

For additional convenience, use `unified_diff_str` directly with (unsplit) strings:

```python
from difflib_rs import unified_diff_str

# Compare two strings directly - no need to split first!
text_a = """line1
line2
line3"""

text_b = """line1
modified
line3"""

# The function handles splitting internally (more efficient)
diff = unified_diff_str(
    text_a, text_b,
    fromfile='original.txt',
    tofile='modified.txt',
    keepends=False  # Whether to keep line endings in the diff
)

for line in diff:
    print(line, end='')
```

The `unified_diff_str` function:
- Takes strings directly instead of lists
- Handles line splitting internally in Rust (faster than Python's `splitlines()`)
- Supports `\n`, `\r\n`, and `\r` line endings
- Has a `keepends` parameter to preserve line endings in the output

## String Splitting Performance

Performance comparison of `unified_diff_str` vs `unified_diff` with Python `splitlines()`:

| File Size | Python split + Rust diff | All Rust (`unified_diff_str`) | Speedup |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 100 lines | 0.0000s | 0.0000s | 1.88x |
| 500 lines | 0.0002s | 0.0001s | 1.39x |
| 1000 lines | 0.0003s | 0.0003s | 1.27x |
| 2000 lines | 0.0007s | 0.0006s | 1.22x |

## API

The `unified_diff` function accepts the same parameters as Python's `difflib.unified_diff`:

- `a`, `b`: Sequences of lines to compare
- `fromfile`, `tofile`: Filenames for the diff header
- `fromfiledate`, `tofiledate`: File modification dates
- `n`: Number of context lines (default: 3)
- `lineterm`: Line terminator (default: '\n')

## Development

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/test_benchmark.py -s

# Build the package with optimizations
